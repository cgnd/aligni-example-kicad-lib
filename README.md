# Aligni Example KiCad Library

This is an example stand-alone KiCad library which shows how to configure a KiCad database library from a SQLite database generated by [Aligni Replicator](https://docs.aligni.com/tools/replicator/).

It is intended to be used with the [aligni-example-kicad-project](https://github.com/cgnd/aligni-example-kicad-project) and is pulled into that project as a git submodule. Check out the project [README](https://github.com/cgnd/aligni-example-kicad-project/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on how to test out the database library functionality provided by this library.
